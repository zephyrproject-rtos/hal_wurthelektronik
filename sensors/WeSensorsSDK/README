Würth Elektronik Sensors SDK
############################

Origin:
   WE Sensors SDK for STM32
   https://github.com/WurthElektronik/Sensors-SDK_STM32

Status:
   Version v2.5

Purpose:
   Drivers for sensors by Würth Elektronik

Description:
   This package is an extract of the Sensors SDK for STM32 provided by Würth
   Elektronik (examples and platform-specific files have been removed).
   
   It contains standard drivers for WE sensors, offering a common, easy-to-use
   interface for all sensor functions.

   The driver is platform-independent, you only need to provide the following
   low-level read and write functions:
   
   /* Read a register's content */
   extern int8_t WE_ReadReg(WE_sensorInterface_t *interface, uint8_t regAdr,
                            uint16_t numBytesToRead, uint8_t *data);

   /* Write a register's content */
   extern int8_t WE_WriteReg(WE_sensorInterface_t *interface, uint8_t regAdr,
                             uint16_t numBytesToWrite, uint8_t *data);

   The functions need to be declared in a header file called "weplatform.h".

Dependencies:
   None.
